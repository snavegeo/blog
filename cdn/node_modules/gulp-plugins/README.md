- contents: function(fileContent), pass file.contents.toString(), and will assign back with new Buffer()
- ext: string, will change extension (one dot only) with new one.
- file: function(file, cb), pass vinyl file as is, and cb, which need to call cb(null, file) to pipe
- collect: function(file), pass the vinyl file as is, and file will drop from pipe
